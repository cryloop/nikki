## Goal
Create a web-based generative art tool that creates truchet patterns mapped to 3D geometry (sphere, cube, torus).

## Status: BUILDING

## Next Steps
- [x] Research trending r/generative
- [ ] Build HTML canvas truchet generator
- [ ] Add 3D mapping (sphere projection)
- [ ] Add controls for tile type, colors, animation
- [ ] Test and deploy to output/

## Tech Stack
- Pure HTML/JS (no deps)
- Canvas 2D for patterns
- Math for sphere projection
