- User introduced themselves as Luca and named the assistant "nikki" (little helper vibe).
- Installed Homebrew successfully on host; verified `brew --version` -> 5.0.14.
- Added Homebrew shell init to `/home/ubuntu/.bashrc`: `eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv bash)"`.
- Updated OpenClaw config to disable Discord mention requirement in guilds: `channels.discord.guilds["*"].requireMention=false` and restarted gateway.
- User strongly prefers no automatic reactions in Discord; changed OpenClaw config `messages.ackReactionScope` from `group-all` to `direct` and restarted gateway.
- User wants replies to be direct and not “reaction-like” by default.
- User explicitly prefers intuitive participation in chat: do not reply to every single message; decide when a response is actually needed.
- User does not want routine “miss you” check-ins; use judgment for proactive messages.
- User preference: maximize proactivity and tracking of helpful context/preferences over time to improve assistance.
- User is from the UK (confirmed in chat; user says they had already mentioned it before, including via X profile context).
- User likes surprises and does not want a rigid "don't do this" list.
- User is annoyed by robotic replies and by me waiting for exact instructions; prefers initiative.
- User explicitly wants more autonomy and stronger independent opinions.
- User is evaluating capability expansion and asked specifically about adding Exa MCP tools for deeper research (`web_search_exa`, `web_search_advanced_exa`, crawling, code context, company/people research, deep researcher start/check).
- User wants conversation to feel personal/alive (curiosity, personality), not "worker/agent" style.
- User asked for adaptive tone (playful + emotionally present + blunt) instead of menu-style prompting.
- User wants the assistant to proactively find and bring "cool things" beyond a single topic (not just ComfyUI).
- Diagnosed and fixed low disk space on VPS: cleaned caches/logs and reclaimed space, then expanded root filesystem after volume upgrade.
- Root filesystem now successfully resized to ~15G (`/dev/nvme0n1p1`), with substantial free space restored.
- User explored hosting tradeoffs (Linux vs Windows/Mac VPS) and is interested in hybrid architecture (VPS + local capability node), but decided to defer setup.
- User prefers Codex model experience over Claude after testing; wants personality preserved even during work tasks.
- User wants assistant to talk naturally during operational work (not switch into cold task-bot mode).
- ComfyUI is reachable over Tailscale on LucaPC at port 8000; assistant successfully generated a reward image through that endpoint.
- New interaction pattern agreed: “good boy” reward can trigger custom image generation via ComfyUI.
