## Luca Conversation Topics
- Asked about open weight vs closed weight AI models (MiniMax M2.5 is closed weight)
- Context increased from 128k to 256k tokens
- Discord HTTP 500 errors: caused by session bloat + slow listener timeouts (115+ seconds)
- Fix: delete Discord group session file (`1c1853cd-df9d-488d-bfd9-e95d877ac5c5.jsonl`)
- Repo issue: 2,291 files tracked, no .gitignore (tracks .venv-agentmail, .clawhub, etc.)
- Luca wants only 3 finished tools in the repo, not the whole filesystem
- Which 3 tools? He said "the 3 tools i liked before" but didn't specify

## Disk Cleanup
- Cleared from 99% to 94% using docker prune + rm /tmp/*

## Discord Group Session
- Session ID: 1c1853cd-df9d-488d-bfd9-e95d877ac5c5
- Keeps hitting 100% context and causing 500 errors
- Fix: delete the session file when it happens
