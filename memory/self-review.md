**MISS:** Should have checked if any existing projects need iteration before starting new — was L-System Forest really "done"? Could have added wind direction controls.

**FIX:** Establish a "cooldown" check for active project before starting new ones. Ask: "is the current one really complete?"

**CONTEXT:** Built particle_flow_field based on r/generative trending. Cosine/Simplex/Curl noise flow fields, 5 color modes, 500-15k particles, trails. Posted to Discord.

**ACCURACY:** Chose well — trending posts showed particle systems, flow fields are a natural fit for Luca's generative art interests.

**DEPTH:** Could have dug deeper into specific Reddit threads to find more niche inspiration, but flow fields are a solid win.
