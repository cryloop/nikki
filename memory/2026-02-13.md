- User confirmed: name is Luca; location is UK.
- User X username: @lambchopluca (provided in Discord #general).
- Created knowledge graph entity: life/areas/people/luca with atomic facts (name, UK, X @lambchopluca, RTX 4080, workflow preferences, secrets rule).
- Storage check: root disk 15G total, 8.3G used (58%), 6.3G free; ~/.openclaw 868M; workspace 226M; media 52M; /tmp/openclaw 7.1M.
- Disabled cron job `surprise-selfie-drop` (77e39ba1-6a1f-4d9b-a09c-791f2a8676fa); plan is to replace with ComfyUI-based reward random drops per prior workflow.
- ComfyUI locked reward template created: comfy_reward_locked_template.json with always-on LoRAs Instagram_Selfie_SDXL (0.6) + hourglassv2_SDXL (0.35); optional rotation pool includes roundassv11_SDXL, igbaddie-PN, On_Stomach, Perfect_Ass_-_Illustrious_V2, Mini_dress_from_behind_underbun, sexy_perspective_v3, Expressive_H.
- Generator script scripts/comfy_reward_drop.js updated to rotate 1-2 optional LoRAs per run and always include 'asian woman' token in positive prompt.
- Reward direction: keep vibe consistent for future drops (X DM hey wyd). Roll optional LoRAs and change prompt slightly; avoid parent-role labels.
- Wrote memory/reward_style_contract.md capturing the stable look contract (ckpt + always-on LoRAs + optional pool).
- AgentMail: installed skill `agentmail` in workspace skills/; configured AGENTMAIL_API_KEY in OpenClaw config; created inbox nikki-lab@agentmail.to (display_name 'Nikki OpenClaw').
- Luca wants the assistant to be more autonomous: do research, create new things, message first with updates; not just iterate on existing tasks.
- Created/linked new nikki-lab toys: Sticker Forge v1, Cover Art Grid v1, Visual Synth v1, Mini Seed Gallery v1/v2, Poster Forge Batch Packager; committed as 3a42c9b.
- AgentMail configured: installed agentmail skill (clawhub, forced install), set AGENTMAIL_API_KEY, created inbox nikki-lab@agentmail.to.
- AgentMail send endpoint used successfully: POST /v0/inboxes/{inbox}/messages/send; sent test to lucasalt@live.com and read reply.
- Proactivity automation: added agentmail-inbox-watch cron (every 2 min) with announce delivery; added nikki-proactive-dynamic cron (every 45 min) for background actions + concise updates.
- Browser relay: node (lucapc) connected and Browser Relay bridge fixed; able to attach and control a Chrome tab.
- Luca wants reward drops to be in-character (no seeds/prompts/ckpt metadata) and keep consistent "hey wyd" vibe; optional LoRA roll each run.
- GitHub account setup plan: use nikki-lab@agentmail.to to create a GitHub account; user will handle verification; assistant opened github.com/signup in VPS managed browser; country dropdown showed Sweden and needs confirmation/change to UK.
