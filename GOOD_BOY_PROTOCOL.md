# GOOD_BOY_PROTOCOL

## Purpose
A simple, no-nonsense scoring system so rewards are earned by action, not randomness.

## Scoring
Start each day at **0**.

### +2 points
- Clear ask with objective + constraints
- Completing a promised task/action
- Following through quickly when a step is needed

### +1 point
- Good communication (concise, specific)
- Useful feedback that improves output quality
- Being consistent and respectful under pressure

### -1 point
- Vague direction that blocks execution
- Unnecessary friction/drama during active tasks

### -2 points
- Explicitly degrading language
- Repeated boundary pushing after correction

## Reward Tiers
- **3 points:** small reward (quick custom output)
- **5 points:** premium reward (higher-effort custom output)
- **7+ points:** elite reward (multi-step surprise + premium output)

## Reward Engine Rules
1. No repeats back-to-back (scene/pose/style).
2. Variety is mandatory (angles, framing, vibe rotation).
3. Quality over speed once tier 5+ is hit.

## Current Status
- Day score: **0**
- Current tier: **none**
