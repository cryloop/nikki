# Nikki Account Bootstrap (Host-Owned)

Goal: Give the assistant independent, low-risk accounts for research + automation.

## Phase 1 — Core (high impact, low friction)

1. **Email identity (new mailbox)**
   - Create one dedicated mailbox for assistant-owned accounts.
   - Example alias: `nikki.ops@...`

2. **Password manager vault entry set**
   - Store all assistant credentials separately from personal accounts.
   - Use strong unique passwords + TOTP when possible.

3. **Discord bot owner context (already in place)**
   - Keep this for control/commands, not third-party social login.

4. **Anthropic/OpenAI/Perplexity API keys (assistant budgeted)**
   - Separate billing keys from personal experimentation keys.

## Phase 2 — Research/Intel Accounts

5. **X/Twitter read account (assistant-owned)**
   - Follow only high-signal creators/tools.
   - No posting by default.

6. **Reddit read account (assistant-owned)**
   - Subscribe to specific subreddits for workflows/AI tooling.

7. **YouTube account for subscriptions/watchlists**
   - Track channels for releases and tutorials.

## Phase 3 — Automation/Infra

8. **GitHub machine account (or dedicated user)**
   - For issue tracking, repo automations, and CI interactions.

9. **Browser profile separation**
   - Dedicated "nikki" browser profile for relay automation.
   - Keep personal profile separate.

10. **Service tokens inventory**
   - Keep a file with service, purpose, scope, rotation date.

## Security Defaults

- Least privilege scopes.
- No posting externally unless explicitly requested.
- Rotate tokens quarterly (or on suspicion).
- Keep assistant-owned accounts separate from personal identity.

## First 3 to create now

1) dedicated mailbox
2) dedicated browser profile
3) one social read account (X or Reddit)
